# I am Moriori

"I Am Moriori" is a collection of eight short videos, where Moriori individuals—Rana, Ajay, Hayden, Tiriana, Deb, Belinda, Jared, and Loretta—share personal reflections on what it means to be Moriori today. In these intimate two-minute stories, they explore their connections to culture, identity, and the ongoing revival of Moriori heritage.
