# Top of page content

If populated, this content will appear at the top of the page when the app is opened.

It is useful for providing a brief introduction to the document, or for providing a table of contents.

The content can be written in standard [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) syntax.

This only renders if the user has already unlocked other content.
